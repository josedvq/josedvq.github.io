We ask whether annotations of laughter are congruent across modalities, and compare the effect that labeling modality has on machine learning model performance. We compare annotations and models for laughter detection, intensity estimation, and segmentation, three tasks common in previous studies of laughter.

Unfortunately individual audio recordings are not available in many social interaction datasets due to subject privacy and logistic challenges. However, video and wearable sensors make it possible to recognize speaking in an unobtrusive, privacy-preserving way through body movement information. When considering the video modality, a bounding box is traditionally used in action recognition problems to localize the target subject whose action is to be assessed. However, cross-contamination, occlusion, and the articulated nature of the human body, make bounding boxes unsuitable in crowded scenes. We address this problem via a method making use of articulated body poses for subject localization and in the subsequent speech detection stage. We show that the selection of local features around pose keypoints has a positive effect on generalization performance while also significantly reducing the number of local features considered, making for a more efficient method. Using two in-the-wild datasets with different viewpoints of subjects, we investigate the role of cross-contamination in this effect. We additionally make use of acceleration measured through wearable sensors for the same task, and present a multimodal approach combining both methods.",papers:[{title:"No-audio speaking status detection in crowded settings via visual pose-based filtering and wearable acceleration",authors:"Jose Vargas-Quiros, Laura Cabrera-Quiros, Hayley Hung",url:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00549",date:"2019"},{title:"Multimodal Data Collection for Social Interaction Analysis In-the-Wild",authors:"Hayley Hung, Chirag Raman, Ekin Gedik, Stephanie Tan and Jose Vargas",publication:"MM '19 - Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia",url:"https://dl-acm-org.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1145/3343031.3351320",date:"2019"}]},{title:"LaRed dataset: a mingling dataset with high-quality individual audio",description:"Recognizing voice activity from human speakers in a multimodal recording is a central task towards the understanding of the social interactions occurring within it.

KRIMP code tables have shown to be useful models of databases for multiple machine learning tasks including classification and clustering. Cross-compression sizes obtained from KRIMP code tables are a generalization of cross-entropy capable of taking into account such co-occurrence relations. This work focuses on the application of KRIMP cross-compression in two different but overlapping areas. First, an unsupervised anomalous database detection algorithm is presented, capable of taking into account database structure. The algorithm is tested on itemset databases with a significant amount of structure to characterize its behavior and an experiment is performed on text data. Second, the application of KRIMP to natural language is investigated further, in the context of authorship attribution via classification. The KRIMP classifier is a generalization of the Naive Bayes classifier capable of combining frequently co-occurring words or items into itemsets, delivering an appealing comparison between the two algorithms. Different ways of transforming text into itemset form were explored, as well as two different ways of applying Laplace smoothing. Experiments indicated that co-occurrence relations are important for attribution, with KRIMP being more robust and in most cases more accurate on prose text when the complete alphabet is considered and itemsets are created per sentence. The behavior suggests that there is relevant syntactic structure at the sentence level involving punctuation and function words that is captured in KRIMP code tables, and is characteristic of individual authors.",papers:[{title:"Information-theoretic anomaly detection and authorship attribution in literature",authors:"Jose Vargas-Quiros",publication:"Universiteit Utrecht",url:"https://josedvq.github.io/msc_thesis.pdf",date:"2017"}]}],S=()=>n.createElement(n.Fragment,null,R.map(((e,t)=>n.createElement(L,(0,T.Z)({key:t},e)))));var D=a(9722);const _=[{name:"linkedin",classname:"fab fa-linkedin fa-fw",link:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/josedvq/"},{name:"github",classname:"fab fa-github fa-fw",link:"https://github.com/josedvq"},{name:"instagram",classname:"fab fa-instagram fa-fw",link:"https://www.instagram.com/josedvq/"},{name:"mail",classname:"fa-solid fa-envelope",link:"mailto:josedvq@gmail.com"}],H=e=>{switch(e){case"linkedin":return"#0a66c2";case"github":return"purple";case"youtube":return"#c4302b";case"mail":return"brown";default:return"blue"}},q=()=>{const e="dark"===(0,w.I)().colorMode;return n.createElement("div",null,_.map((t=>n.createElement("a",{href:t.link,target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",key:t.classname},n.createElement(D.Z,{className:t.classname,sx:{color:e?"white":"black",fontSize:30,marginTop:1,marginRight:1,"&:hover":{color:`${H(t.name)}`}}})))))}}}]);
